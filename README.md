# DocBlockr for Nova

Work in progress!

This started as a port of [DocBlockr for Atom](https://github.com/nikhilkalige/docblockr) by Nikhil Kalige, which is a port of [DocBlockr for Sublime Text](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs) by Nick Fisher. By now large parts of the original code were refactored and I basically kept the RegExp only. More or less. There are still a lot of things missing, like comment continuation or reformatting doc blocks. Not sure how much of the original version I can bring to Nova.

For now you can start a doc block by typing `/**` in the editor:
